As far as I can remember, I've been spending the majority of my time behind the computer's display. 
I love computers and I'm still amazed about the fact that we managed to apply some electricity into
a bunch of rocks and metals and build such a magnificent thing. 

My favorite language is C and I try to learn comupter hardware in low level by coding in it and building cool stuff. 

If you like to reach out to me you can use my Telegram in my bio. Happy coding! ðŸ–¥
