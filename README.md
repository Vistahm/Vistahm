As far as I can remember, I've been spending the majority of my time with computers. 
I love computers and I'm still amazed about the fact that we managed to apply some electricity into
a bunch of rocks and metals and build such a magnificent thing. 

I've been programming for a couple of years and I've worked with multiple languages including C, Java, Kotlin, Python and Go.
My favorite language is C and I try to learn comupter hardware in low level by coding in it and building cool stuff.
I also hate doing any sort of FrontEnd!

If you like to reach out to me to talk about code and tech or anything else, feel free to shoot me a message in Telegram.
The link is in my bio. Happy coding! ðŸ–¥
